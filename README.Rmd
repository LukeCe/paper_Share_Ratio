# Pairwise share ratio interpretations of compositional regression models

This repository contains all codes necessary to reproduce the results of our article *"`r Title`"*, available at:

> Dargel, Lukas, and Christine Thomas-Agnan (2024).
> *`r Title`*.

The vignette accompanying the article illustrates the presented mathematical tools for a case study of French electoral sociology and can be [downloaded directly as HTML](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LukeCe/paper_Share_Ratio/blob/master/notebooks/Modeling%20the%20French%20presidential%20elections%20of%202022%20with%20CoDa%20tools.html).

## Notes on reproducibility

To reproduce the results, you can run the bash commands below:

``` {.bash .sh}
# get all codes from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/LukeCe/paper_Share_Ratio
cd paper_Share_Ratio # change working directory to the cloned git

# build the docker image for the paper from the current directory
docker build -t repro_share_ratio . 

# run the analysis from within the docker container
docker run --rm \
  -v .:/home/paper_Share_Ratio \  # mount the repository into the docker
  -w '/home/paper_Share_Ratio' \  # change working directory accordingly
  repro_share_ratio \             # specfiy the docker image
  Rscript repro.R                 # execute the repro.R script
```

Executing the command `Rscript repro.R` performs the following steps:

1.  Download the three source data sets and places them in `in\data`:

    -   Election results [from the French Ministry of the Interior](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/election-presidentielle-des-10-et-24-avril-2022-resultats-definitifs-du-1er-tour/#/resources)
    -   Socio-demographic information from the population census [provided by INSEE](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/6543200)
    -   Geographic contours of French municipalities [provided by IGN](https://geoservices.ign.fr/adminexpress) (this file has about 250MB and can take some time to download)

2.  Merge the data sources and place the combined data in `out/data`

3.  Rebuild the HTML vignette that generates all results used in the article

    -   The vignette is placed in `notebooks`
    -   The outputs used for the article are placed in `out/figures` and `out/tables`
